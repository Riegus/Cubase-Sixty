# Known issues

Bugs seen in testing and noted for later. Each entry: what happens, where, and what is known about the cause.

## UF1

- **Send levels lag** (UF8 send views, UF1 send V-pots). Moving a send with a fader or V-pot follows a little behind;
  volume and pan do not. The same on the UF1, so it is how Cubase handles send levels from MIDI Remote scripts, not
  the views. To look into: whether Direct Access on the send parameters is quicker.
- **Track change may lag a little** (since the CHANNEL encoder push / SHIFT + turn, 7.11.2026). Stepping the track
  with the UF1's CHANNEL encoder felt slower; sixteen insert viewers were replaced by one, which helped, but it is not
  sure it is as quick as before. To check against `cubase` without the change; suspects: the PLUGIN scan's extra slot
  reads, the insert viewer.
